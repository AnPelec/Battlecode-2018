# Battlecode-2018
Our team's (obas) participation in Battlecode 2018, an AI programming competition held in MIT.

In this repository, you may find our progress in the Battlecode 2018 Competition. Even though it was our team's first try, our bot performed ery well, losing a ticket for the final on the second to last round!

In this repository you may find:
  * slow_strategy: Our first strategy. This bot was playing very efficiently, but was timing out in the early rounds due to the excessive number of computations required in each round
  * fast_strategy: After experiencing slow_strategy's limitations, we decided to include randomization in our bot. This was our first try to trade some time for accuracy. Unfortunately, even if this bot turned out to be extremely fast, its actions were suboptimal.
